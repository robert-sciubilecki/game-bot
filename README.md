"Like many Python projects, my inspiration for this project 
came from the '100 Days of Code' challenge. Currently, 
I'm not relying heavily on instructions; instead, 
I'm actively searching for solutions online. 
The ChatGPT AI has been incredibly helpful in explaining methods 
and assisting in finding relevant documentation.

This marks my first step into using Selenium, 
and I'm genuinely proud of my progress so far. 
While it may be a straightforward project, 
I had a great time devising a well-thought-out algorithm for it."

Please, have a go at playing cookie clicker with it :)
